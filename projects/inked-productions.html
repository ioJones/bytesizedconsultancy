            <h3 class="'sub_title">Challenge</h3>
            <p class="article_text">Inked Productions was in need of setting up a film edit suite with three rooms, all connected by a shared storage solution. They were in search of a reliable and efficient system to support their film production process.</p>
            <h3 class="'sub_title">Solution</h3>
            <p class="article_text">Exorcist Systems implemented a cloud-based storage solution that would allow the team at Inked Productions to access their files and projects from any room. This solution made it possible for the team to work together seamlessly on large-scale projects without having to transfer files between rooms. The Exorcist Systems team also set up a secure network that ensured the confidentiality of the clients' projects and data.</p>
            <h3 class="'sub_title">Impact</h3>
            <p class="article_text">The implementation of the cloud-based storage solution and secure network had a significant impact on the productivity and workflow of Inked Productions. The team was able to complete projects faster and more efficiently, with less downtime. The clients were also pleased with the level of security and peace of mind that came with having their projects and data protected.
